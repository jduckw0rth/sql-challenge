# Employee SQL Database

# IMAGINE:
- Itâ€™s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). 
  Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
  All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

- Diagram and SQL code for table schemata is included as well as some sample queries.
